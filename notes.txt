1. react-dom/client
2. Parcel does -  

    Hot module reload or HMR, 
    File watcher algorithm written in C++ 
    ImageOptimization
    Caching while development
    compatible with older version of browsers- Adds polyfills
    HTTPS on dev
    Differen port number for each project 
    Superfast
    Consistent hashing algorithm
    Tree Shaking- removing unwanted code


3. When we use Parcel we do not require entry point in package.json, so remove ["main": "App.js",] from 
    package.json
4. Parcel during build command- bundles, minifies, cleans like removing console.log 
5. Media like Images etc is the heaviest in the website and take a lot of time to load 


Date 27 Aug

1. Transitive dependencies


    A----->B------->C

    A--------------->C   (transitive dependency)

    if A is dependent on B , and B is dependent on C,
    then A is transitive dependent on C


2. Dependency tree
Parcel documentation
browserlist.dev, query composition --> Helps in making the application compatible for 
the older browsers.

Normal dependencies and Dev dependency in package.json
