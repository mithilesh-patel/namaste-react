1. react-dom/client
2. Parcel does -  

    Hot module reload or HMR, 
    File watcher algorithm written in C++ 
    ImageOptimization
    Caching while development
    compatible with older version of browsers- Adds polyfills
    HTTPS on dev
    Differen port number for each project 
    Superfast
    Consistent hashing algorithm


3. When we use Parcel we do not require entry point in package.json, so remove ["main": "App.js",] from 
    package.json
4. Parcel during build command- bundles, minifies, cleans like removing console.log 
5. Media like Images etc is the heaviest in the website and take a lot of time to load
